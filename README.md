### Important information 

If you are using the simulator (or parts of it) for a publication, then you *must* cite our paper:

S. H. Mirfarshbafan, A. Gallyas-Sanhueza, R. Ghods, and C. Studer, "Beamspace Channel Estimation for Massive MIMO mmWave Systems: Algorithm and VLSI Design", IEEE Trans. Circuits Syst. I (TCAS-I), to appear, 2020

and clearly mention this in your paper.  In the following, by *paper*, we mean the above paper.

### How to start a simulation:

To regenerate the plots in figures 4 and 5 of the paper, simply assign one of the letters `'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'` or `'d'` to the variable `sim_scenario` in the `main_sim.m` 
and run the script. It will generate a plot with BER curves and another one with MSE curves corresponding to the chosen letter (subfigure) of figure 4 and 5, respectively.
Also note that the list of denoisers to be simulated are set in the `par.denoiser_list` variable in the `par_config.m` file. 

_**IMPORTANT**_: The TF variable `INCLUDE_ANM_NOMP` in `main_sim.m` determines whether NOMP and ANM should be simulated along with other denoisers. 
For ANM and NOMP to work, please download their codes at [https://github.com/badrinarayan/astlinespec] and [https://bitbucket.org/wcslspectralestimation/continuous-frequency-estimation/src/NOMP/], respectively and extract the zip files to `./denoisers/` directory of the simulator.

In order to simulate with simulation parameters other than the default ones, define a new set of parameters in the `switch case` block of `par_config.m` file and assign a value to the variable `sim_scenario` in the `main_sim.m` that corresponds to the new set of parameters. Please consider the following guidelines when creating a new set of simulation parameters:
- Assign a unique runID to each simulation scenario to enable reproducibility and to make different simulations distinguishable.
- Set the number of BS antennas and UEs and other parameters in the `par_config.m` file. Note that channel condition in `par.channel` has to be set to one of the values defined in `./channel/channel.m`.
   _**IMPORTANT**_: The LoS and nonLoS mmMagic channel models which are generated by the QuaDRiGa channel simulator ([https://quadriga-channel-model.de/]) are
    available only for the default simulation scenarios (a,b,c,d) which correspond to the paper simulation settings. We have included a set of per-generated channel matrices for the default simulation parameters, using the QuaDRiGa matlab code, as mat files and stored them in `./channel/generated_channels/`. The function `generate_channels` accepts the par struct which contains the parameters of simulation as its
	input argument. It first searches the folder `./channel/generated_channels/` to see if the channels with requested parameters already exist as mat files. If not it attempts to generate them 
	by calling the function `channel`. However, if the channel type assigned to `par.channel` is `'QuadMMLoS'` or `QuadMMnLoS'`, it cannot generate new channels unless the QuaDRiGa package is on the simulation path. Interested readers can download the QuaDRiGa software package, unzip the package and add it to matlab's path,
	and then generate realistic channels for their desired set of parameters.
	
- Tha cell array `par.denoiser_list` defines the denoisers to be simulated. The number of elements in this array must match the number of elements (which are row vectors) of the cell arrays `par.SNRdB_list_L`
	and `par.n_channel_trials_L`. For example, the `l`th denoiser of the list `par.SNRdB_list_L` is simulated over the SNR values defined by the `l`th vector in the cell array `par.SNRdB_list_L`. The entries of the `l`th vector in
	the cell array `par.n_channel_trials_L`, determine the number of channel realization (per worker) to be simulated in each SNR point. The overall number of trials in each SNR point `k` is given by  
	`par.n_channel_trials_L{l}(k)*par.trials_per_channel*par.n_parallel_workers`. Note that `main_sim.m` consists of a `parfor` that launches `par.n_parallel_workers` parallel workers that each simulate
	`par.n_channel_trials*par.trials_per_channel` trials and then fuses the results of these parallel workers to get better averaging and more reliable error rate results. Additionally, this allows for a faster
	simulation by leveraging matlab's parallel computing features whenever supported by the underlying machine.
- The simulation results, as well as the par struct holding all the simulation parameters, for each denoiser simulation are saved as a mat file in the `./results/sim_res` subfolder. The `plot_BER` and `plot_MSE` 

We highly recommend you to execute the code step-by-step (using MATLAB's debug mode) in order to get a detailed understanding of the simulator.
In order to do so, you should change the parfor in the `main_sim.m` to a simple for (just replace parfor with for) so that debugging is possible.
